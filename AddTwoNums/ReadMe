You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First solution that comes to mind:
Create a new node for the result list.
Loop through the two lists, each loop look at the two node values, add them together and store them in the new result node.
If the addition results in a number great than or equal to ten, the carry must be handled.
I can modulo the result of the addition, the remainder will be stored in the current node.
    I will also need to subtract 10 from this value until I have a number that is <= 9 and take note of how many tens need to be carried over.
