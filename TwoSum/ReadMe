Goal: Given an array of integers as input and a given an target integer
return the indices of two integers that sum up to the target integer.

* You may assume that each input has exactly one solution.
* Elements of the array may only be used once.
* The answer may be returned in any order.

Ex.):
input=[2,7,11,15], target=9
Expected Output=[0,1] (Because 2(n=0) + 7(n=1) = 9)

Easy Method:
Nested loop. Loops through each value in the array of integers.
First loop gets the integer, X, being checked against all others, integers. 
the nested loop, loops through all other integers, Y, and adds
the two integers X and Y together to make integer Z
Z is then compared to the target integer, if it matches return the index
values of X and Y. Otherwise continue looping.
